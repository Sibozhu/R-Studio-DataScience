#Region name : Subcontinent West


#Summary and EDA of reported data.

##The Condition of the Data and Interesting Detail 

\indent Without considering the location, lowest temperature is usually between December and January, while the highest temperatures around August. According to the geography, subcontinent west is close to equator so the temperature difference through the year should not be noticeable.  Since water has bigger specific heat capacity, from the equation $\Delta$T=Q/mc ($\Delta$=temperature change, Q=heat, m=mass, c=specific heat capacity), we can predict that the sea temperature change has a smaller range than that of air temperature, which is consistence with our plots.  Also, in our plots, there’s no pattern showing increase or decrease of temperature from 2001 to 2016.\par



##The Data Acquisition and Density of Data.

\indent  For our analysis purpose, ship data is used instead of buoy data, since buoy data only contains the measurement of water depth. Ship data is dependent on the fact that ships needed to be passing through our assigned area. Data from VOS website is divided per month from 2001 to 2016. we make sure the range is in sub-continent west by limit the range of latitude from 6 to 20 and longitude from 60 to 80. In order to make data fit into preferred region while remaining consistent through years, we measure our data within a 6-hour range of noon. We dropped all the data with "NA" value in order to keep our data logically and easy for analysis. By dropping extreme measurement that out of range between (0.01,0.99), we kept the consistency of our data.\par

#Maps

\indent We created maps per year which show the data of Sub-Continent West region from 2001 to 2016. As we can see, when times goes on, records showing that there are more and more ship lanes are travel through this area and more data is collected in Sub-Continent West.
